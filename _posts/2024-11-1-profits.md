## With the ever increasing costs and development times of AAA games, have large game studios stopped caring about the quality of the game in favor of chasing profit to recoup costs?

Five years ago it cost $50 to $150 million on average to develop a AAA game, but as of recently the prices have skyrocketed to $200 million or more according to the CMA’s report (Anastasia, 2024). In addition, development times for AAA games are usually between 2 and 7 years. With these increased costs and increased time of development, the pressure for the game to be a success and recoup the costs of development is high but strangely the prices of games are lower than the years prior with Graph 1 from gamesindustry.biz showing the release prices adjusted for the 2022 price equivalent adjusted using a US inflation calculator (Naji, 2022\).

*Graph 1: Adjusted Release Prices*

Gamers are highly resistant to games’ base price increasing and are used to sales decreasing games cost even further. So how are games companies recording record breaking profit? Well even with the inflation adjusted price of games trending downward, the amount of added paid content known as microtransactions to games is increasing (*Rising costs, stagnant prices: How video game companies ...*). There's now two main approaches developers of AAA games take for pricing their games. The first consists of a $70 upfront price for the game followed by downloadable content or DLC that serves as expansions as well as additional microtransactions for cosmetic items. In the second approach the game is free, however microtransactions are more heavily pushed to the audience. With the heavy emphasis on microtransactions in both models, there's a growing sentiment that developers care more about the microtransactions than the game itself leading the a drop in the quality of games. However, current data doesn't fully support this sentiment. MIDiA researcher, Perry Gresham, discovered that while the median rating of games on TrueAchievements, an Xbox gaming community, dropped from 3.5/5 in 2014 to 2.9/5 in 2021 and the amount of 4/5 or more rated games dropped by 10% in the same time frame, the number of 4.5/5 rated games doubled in number (Gresham, 2023). The data suggests a lower barrier of entry for game development resulting in lower quality control thus making it difficult to find good games in a flooded market of lower quality games.   

So to answer the question on whether game developers are pursuing profit over quality, no, the existing data doesn’t support the claim that the quality of games has dropped as microtransactions increase, but rather game quality decreasing on average due to decreased barriers of entry for game development through tools such as artificial intelligence.
