# Grand Theft Auto 5: In Retrospect

With nearly 210,000,000 copies sold, Grand Theft Auto 5 is the second most sold video game in history - and that isn’t without good reason. Grand Theft Auto Online continues to receive updated content, and continues to attract new players. Twelve, nearly thirteen years after GTA 5’s original release on the PlayStation 3, and with GTA VI on the horizon, it is worth looking back at how GTA 5 cemented its position as one of the most popular video games of all time. 

## A History

To truly understand where Grand Theft Auto 5 went right, and where other games fell short, one must understand the context of the time, even before the game was released. 2011 and 2012 were excellent years for video games, with titles like Skyrim, Portal 2 and Far Cry 3, but there was nothing truly like Grand Theft Auto 5 on the market. GTA IV was a thing, but the game’s dark storyline and equally dark visuals were not quite conducive to the open-world success that was GTA 5. Far Cry 3, while visually similar, with a colorful, tropical open world, was a shooter, and purely a shooter. There was no amazing driving physics, or banal daily activities, it was a world built around missions, rather than missions built around a world. 

When the GTA V trailer released, a very high bar was established for what the game could be. The trailer greets you with stunning visuals, volumetric lighting, high resolution models, leaps and bounds ahead of the games at the time. The trailer takes you to various locations around the Los Angeles County-inspired world of San Andreas, demonstrating a detailed world with scope, and action. Rockstar Games established massive expectations of what the game would be, preparing players for a style of open world that truly had not been tried before.

When GTA V was finally released on the PlayStation 3 in September of 2013, early reviews praised the attention to detail and the interactivity of a world that felt alive. Even in 2024, the game remains vastly more detailed than newer open-world releases, like Forza Horizon 5, superseded only by Rockstar’s own Red Dead Redemption 2. Take for example, these screenshots. Rockstar’s worlds feel alive because that was what they set out to create. Rockstar sent location scouts to real-world locations, spending millions of dollars and years of research to develop open worlds that feel lived in, authentic, and where tiny details can be found everywhere you look. The map was an expansive replica of California, even featuring a number of landmarks from my (largely rural) hometown, like FCI Victorville and George Air Force Base, in the form of the in-game Bolingbroke Penitentiary and Sandy Shores Airfield respectively. I often find myself driving around the rural parts of the game just to experience a little taste of home. Rockstar nailed the look and feel perfectly - from the attention to detail in the featured plants, to the general atmosphere of desert life.

Below the surface of the original release of GTA 5 on the PS3 was incredibly well-written and optimized code. The PS3 was unique, with a specially designed IBM PowerPC-based Cell microprocessor, which was among one of the most powerful processors at the time, to the point that the US Air Force used shelves of PS3’s to build one of the fastest supercomputers in history. The PS3 paired the unique CPU with 256 MB of RAM, with an additional 256 MB of VRAM for the NVIDIA G70 GPU. This was not a lot of memory, even for the time. The limiting factor for games at the time was the Cell processor. The unique processor architecture had six specialised cores, called Synergistic Processing Elements, that effectively functioned as independent processors, making optimized code very hard to write. Most developers did not put the time into optimizing their games around the unique processor architecture, leaving gamers with subpar performance. The long wait for the release of GTA V enabled Rockstar to write truly optimized code for the PS3, which optimized well when the game was finally released on PC. This study by Adrian Courreges provides a more in depth analysis of the impressive levels of optimization in the game. 

Outside of the location and technicals, where the game shines is the storytelling, both environmentally and literally. Grand Theft Auto 5 tells its story from the perspective of three criminal protagonists, who take on fighting issues affecting their communities while stealing cars and robbing banks. The idea of a story that is told from the perspective of three characters, rather than 1 was, and still is, unique. Michael, a retired career bank robber teams up with Trevor, a violent career criminal and drug trafficker to mentor Franklin, a young and inexperienced criminal from the game’s equivalent of Compton. The trio take on a number of issues, from marital disputes to corruption at the highest levels of government. The story of Grand Theft Auto 5 is leveled as an expansive critique of all aspects of life in the United States, from consumerism, to corruption and, ironically, the proliferation of violent media. As humans who yearn for justice, for things to be made right, Grand Theft Auto 5 provides catharsis. The player fights consumerism by sabotaging the release of a smartphone, and smashing into billboards. The player fights government corruption by robbing federal buildings and taking down corrupt agents. The player fights the proliferation of violence by moving down hordes of private military contractors and their billionaire investor. The missions, and the targets of the missions provide the players with a feeling of satisfaction - that they are personally doing something to fix the issues plaguing society, and the realistic graphics and setting enhance the illusion. 

12 years later, the themes present in Grand Theft Auto V continue to hold up to the test of time. With the Expanded and Enhanced update releasing last year on the PlayStation 5, Grand Theft Auto 5 has established a legacy across three generations of consoles, with boosts in graphical fidelity to complement the already well-developed map and story. The game continues to provide an open space - someone’s own mini-California to do whatever they want.
