I’m going to start this article by answering the question. No, indie games aren’t underrepresented as large game journalists sites like IGN, Rock Paper Shotgun and Polygon all cover indie games and specialised game journalist sites like The Indie Informer, Indie Game Reviewer, and The Indie Game Website solely review indie games. These and other sites along with independent journalists all do their best to cover indie games however, there are many indie games that will inevitably slip through the cracks. The sheer number of indie games published as well as their low discoverability as many indie games don’t have a website or social media account to advertise them leads to many indie games being overlooked (Dealessandri, 2022\) and this issue will only be exacerbated over time as the barrier to entry for game development decreases through tools such as artificial intelligence copilots. Additionally, every game developer from large to small is trying to garner the attention of their customer base, gamers, however, indie developers don’t have nearly the same resources as large studios and don't garner as much attention as a result.

Everyone is fighting for a slice of the pie, however, there's only so much to give. Small game studios producing indie games will inevitably receive the meager share. However, this isn’t an issue of underrepresentation as stated previously, game journalists are producing a significant amount of indie game related content.With the quick proliferation of indie games, it's impossible for all of them to be seen and represented by game journalists and it’s equally impossible for all them to receive the same media attention as the more funded AAA games. However while the existing system isn’t perfect, through different forms of media like youtube, twitter, twitch and more, hidden gems like Lethal Company have been and will continue to be uncovered.
